The [Sustainable Development Goals](https://www.un.org/sustainabledevelopment/sustainable-development-goals/) (SDGs) are a universal call to action to:

  * end poverty
  
  * protect the planet
  
  * improve the lives and prospects of everyone, everywhere

The 17 Goals were adopted by all UN Member States in 2015, as part of the [2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development] (https://sustainabledevelopment.un.org/post2015/transformingourworld/).

This site is based on the open source [Open SDG](https://open-sdg.org/) platform.
    
Open SDG platform in Ukraine was developed by the State Statistics Service of Ukraine in partnership with UNDP Ukraine within  the UN programme  "Promoting Strategic Planning and Financing for Sustainable Development on National and Regional Level in Ukraine" funded by the Joint SDG Fund.
