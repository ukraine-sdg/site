## How do I suggest new or different data sources?
If you have feedback on the data sources we have used or have suggestions for new data sources then please email us at <a href="mailto:{{site.email_contacts.questions}}">{{site.email_contacts.questions}}</a>.

## What are you doing to fill data gaps?
For some indicators, although we may have data at the national level, our existing data sources donâ€™t always allow us to disaggregate by all main groups.

This means we need to look for new data sources, link existing ones, or model data.

## What does the reporting status mean?
We have used three different types of reporting status for an indicator, which are also colour coded:

- **Reported (black):** As a minimum the headline national data for this indicator is available on this website but the data might not be fully disaggregated yet. We are continuing to source additional disaggregations.

- **Statistics in progress (grey):** We have found a suitable source of data for this indicator or relevant proxy at national level. We are currently quality assuring the data and preparing it for publication.

- **Exploring data sources (white):** We are still looking for a suitable data source for this indicator.

- **Not applicable (striped):** This indicator is not applicable in the national context.


## According to which the SDG indicators, are data on platform given?
Yes. See the [Open SDG Quick Start guide](https://open-sdg.readthedocs.io/en/latest/quick-start/) for technical instructions on the quickest way to get a copy of the Open SDG platform up and running.

## What disaggregations are available?
